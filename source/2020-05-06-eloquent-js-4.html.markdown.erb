Welcome to the notes for [Chapter 4: Data Structures: Objects and Arrays](https://eloquentjavascript.net/04_data.html). Let's read, shalln't we?

## Michael's Notes

### Concepts I Don't Understand

### New Vocabulary

**Properties**

Something that a value has. Like _length_ is a value of a string. Every value has properties of some kind, expect null and undefined. Dot notation and bracket notation are the ways to access value properties. With dot notation, the name after the dot is the name of the property. In bracket notation, the name in brackets is evaluated to get the property.

Also, objects have properties. The "item" of an object is called a property.

**Methods**

Properties that contain functions.

**`"propertyName" in objectName`**

The `in` keyword can be used to tell you if a property existsin within a certain object.

**Arrays**

Arrays are a type of object.

**`of` keyword**

You can use the `of` keyword in a for loop to loop over elements of the value given after of (I don't know what this means). Like this:

```
for (let entry of JOURNAL) {
  console.log(`${entry.events.length} events.`);
}
```

Google about this later. Seems important and useful.

**`shift` and `unshift` methods**

These methods add and remove things to the BEGINNING of an array.

`shift` removes the first item from an array.

`unshift` adds an item to the front of an array.

**`indexOf` method**

The `indexOf` method is used to find the index of a certain value in an array. You can also use `lastIndexOf` to start at the end of the array instead of the beginning.

**Immutable Objects**

- strings
- booleans
- integers

**`trim` method**

Removes whitespace from beginning and end of strings.

**`padStart` method**

Takes a string, then add pad character and numbers of pad character as arguments. It adds the number of pad characters to the beginning of the string.

**`repeat` method**

`console.log("LA".repeat(3));`

Add to a string and add number of times to repeat as argument. It's like doing `"string" * 3` in Ruby, which you can't do in JS. I needed this in an exercism!

**three-dot `spread` operator**

You can use three dots before an argument name (`...numbers`), which will take all the items in the array `numbers` and spread them out with spaces. If this is passed in a function as an argument, they will each become individual arguments. This is a way you can pass in one argument and then use it to pass in as many as you want.

**The Math Object**

You can use this object to calculate all kinds of numbers, and it has built in methods to do so.

**Destructuring**

**JSON*

Javascript Object Notation. This is data store in objects, which is stored in a JSON file. You can use this to send your data to other places, or use it easily. Like a data file in yaml (I think).

## Ranodm questions

- Should I refresh calculus, algebra, or other math concepts?
