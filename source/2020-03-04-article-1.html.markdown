There was a lot of talk on Twitter this week about how cats are essentially naked. Sure, they have fur, but this is 2020. We can't have cats being nude in this political climate.

Luckily, I found a lot of clothig for catsâ€”period costumes mostly. Here are some I found:

- Puritan settler
- Boxcar hobo
- Elizabethan duke or duchess
- Chimney sweep
- Snake oil salesman
- Southern debutante with a case of the vapors
- And so forth...
