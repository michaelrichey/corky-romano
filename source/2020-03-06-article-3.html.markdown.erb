Lots of people have theme music these days. Even some dogs have theme music! So who has the best theme music?

I asked forty people what they thought, and they all answered incorrectly.

Here are some of the answers that might be acceptable:

<div>
    <% data.themesongs.each do |song| %>
        <div class="theme-song-card">
            <span><%= song.embed %></span>
            <div class="theme-song-card__info-box">
                <h2>Song Title: <%= song.title %></h2>
                <h3>Show: <%= song.from %></h3>
                <h3>Year: <%= song.year %></h3>
            </div>
        </div>
    <% end %>
</div>

Here are all the themes from the 1980s:

<ul>
    <% eighties_songs.each do |song| %>
        <li><em><%= song.title%></em> from <%= song.from%> (<%= song.year%>)</li>
    <% end %>
</ul>

Here are all the themes from the 1990s:

<ul>
    <% nineties_songs.each do |song| %>
        <li><em><%= song.title%></em> from <%= song.from%> (<%= song.year%>)</li>
    <% end %>
</ul>

That's all! Let me know in the comments if you're wrong!
