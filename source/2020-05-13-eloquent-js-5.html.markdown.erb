Welcome to the notes for [Chapter 5: Higher Order Functions](https://eloquentjavascript.net/05_higher_order.html). Let's learn all about these things.

**Higher-order functions**

Functions that operate on other functions, either by taking them as arguments or by returning them, are called higher-order functions.

**The Filter method**

The filter method returns a new array containing only the elements that pass the predicate function.

All these methods require you to pass in a function that they need to function. They're functions that need another function to run. Therefore, they're higher order functions.
